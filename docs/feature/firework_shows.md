# Firework Shows

EzCountdown includes a `FireworkShowManager` to launch firework displays when countdowns end (configurable per-countdown).

Configuration

- Configure firework effects in `countdowns.yml` under the countdown's end actions or a dedicated `firework` section depending on your setup.

Notes

- Fireworks are launched by the server as console commands or via the plugin's API; ensure the server has permissions and safety checks for the spawns.
- Test firework displays on a non-production world to avoid accidental damage or excessive load.
